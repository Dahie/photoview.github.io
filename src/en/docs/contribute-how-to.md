## Different ways to contribute

### Write code

If you want to help write code for Photoview, take a look at the [open issues](https://github.com/photoview/photoview/issues),
if you find an issue that you'd like to work on, please write a comment on that issue to let others know that you will be working on it.

If you want to add a feature that has no open issue, please create a new one.

If you need help regarding development, you are very welcome to join our [Discord channel](https://discord.gg/jQ392948u9) and ask questions.

### Write documentation

This documentation is far from complete and help in writing it is very much encouraged.
At the top-right of each article there is a pencil icon, that when clicked will take you to GitHub where you can edit the page and send a pull-request when you are done.
If you are unfamiliar with sending pull-requests on GitHub see their article [About collaborative development models](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/getting-started/about-collaborative-development-models).

The documentation is written in [Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).
An implicit level one heading will automatically be added to each page with the page title, theirefore the pages should be written using level two or more headings.

### Help others

Another way to contribute to the community is by helping other set up and use Photoview.
You can do so over at the [Discord channel](https://discord.gg/jQ392948u9) or on various forums.

### Report bugs, suggest new features or improvements

If you find a bug, you can report it such that it can be fixed.
Or if you have an idea for a nice feature that Photoview is lacking you can suggest it and it might be added in a future update.

To do this go to the [issues](https://github.com/photoview/photoview/issues) page and check that an issue for the bug or feature doesn't already exist.
If it doesn't click the "New issue" button and select whether the issue is regarding a bug or a new feature, now fill out the form and finish off by clicking on "Submit new issue".
